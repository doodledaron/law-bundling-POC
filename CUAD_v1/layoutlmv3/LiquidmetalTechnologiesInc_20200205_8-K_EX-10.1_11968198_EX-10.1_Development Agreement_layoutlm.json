Such notice shall include a description of the assets Eutectix will purchase (the \"Optioned Assets\"). (b) In the event that Eutectix and Liquidmetal cannot agree to a fair market value for the Optioned Assets, then the fair market value shall be determined by an independent third-party appraisal. Eutectix and Liquidmetal shall each select one independent, qualified appraiser, and the two so selected shall select a third appraiser, all three to independently from one another determine the fair market value of the Optioned Assets. The purchase price shall be the mean of the fair market values as determined by the three appraisers. (c) The closing for the purchase of the Optioned Assets will take place no later than sixty (60) days after the termination, unless the Parties cannot agree on the price, in which case, closing will take place no later than sixty (60) days after the three independent appraisals have been received. Eutectix will pay the purchase price in full at the closing. Liquidmetal must sign all documents of assignment and transfer as are reasonably necessary for purchase of the Optioned Assets by Liquidmetal. (d) In the event that Eutectix does not exercise its right to purchase the Optioned Assets as set forth above, Liquidmetal will be free to keep or to sell, after such termination to any third party, all of the Optioned Assets and shall be responsible for timely removing equipment not purchased by Eutectix at Liquidmetal's own expense. In the event Liquidmetal fails to timely remove such Optioned Assets, in light of the periods for continued operation in Section 5.4(b)(ii) and closing in Section 5.5(c), Eutectix may dispose of them, at Liquidmetal's cost, with no liability to Eutectix.",

      "question": "Highlight the parts (if any) of this contract related to \"Rofr/Rofo/Rofn\" that should be reviewed by a lawyer. Details: Is there a clause granting one party a right of first refusal, right of first offer or right of first negotiation to purchase, license, market, or distribute equity interest, technology, assets, products or services?",
      "answer_text": "The following additional terms shall apply to Eutectix's exercise of this option: (a) Eutectix's option hereunder shall be exercisable by providing Liquidmetal with written notice of its intention to exercise its chosen option no later than the effective date of termination. Such notice shall include a description of the assets Eutectix will purchase (the \"Optioned Assets\"). (b) In the event that Eutectix and Liquidmetal cannot agree to a fair market value for the Optioned Assets, then the fair market value shall be determined by an independent third-party appraisal. Eutectix and Liquidmetal shall each select one independent, qualified appraiser, and the two so selected shall select a third appraiser, all three to independently from one another determine the fair market value of the Optioned Assets. The purchase price shall be the mean of the fair market values as determined by the three appraisers. (c) The closing for the purchase of the Optioned Assets will take place no later than sixty (60) days after the termination, unless the Parties cannot agree on the price, in which case, closing will take place no later than sixty (60) days after the three independent appraisals have been received. Eutectix will pay the purchase price in full at the closing. Liquidmetal must sign all documents of assignment and transfer as are reasonably necessary for purchase of the Optioned Assets by Liquidmetal. (d) In the event that Eutectix does not exercise its right to purchase the Optioned Assets as set forth above, Liquidmetal will be free to keep or to sell, after such termination to any third party, all of the Optioned Assets and shall be responsible for timely removing equipment not purchased by Eutectix at Liquidmetal's own expense. In the event Liquidmetal fails to timely remove such Optioned Assets, in light of the periods for continued operation in Section 5.4(b)(ii) and closing in Section 5.5(c), Eutectix may dispose of them, at Liquidmetal's cost, with no liability to Eutectix.",
